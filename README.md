This project, titled "Corner Grocer Item Tracker," is a program designed to address the challenge of efficiently analyzing item frequency data for small businesses or individual inventory management.
It reads an input file containing a list of items, calculates their occurrence frequencies, and offers functionalities such as searching for specific item frequencies, displaying sorted data, generating histograms, and saving the results to a backup file.
The modular design of the program stands out, with each function dedicated to a specific task like data loading, error handling, or displaying results, ensuring clarity and maintainability.
Features such as input normalization to lowercase and error-handling mechanisms for file operations and user input validation enhance its usability and robustness. However, there is room for improvement.
Optimizing performance with unordered maps could speed up operations like searching and updating, while sanitizing file inputs and outputs could bolster security against malicious data.
Additionally, implementing incremental backup updates rather than overwriting files would preserve data integrity.
One of the more challenging aspects was developing the histogram display, where alignment needed to accommodate varying item name lengths. This was overcome by leveraging formatting tools like setw for precise alignment.
Another hurdle was ensuring consistent case-insensitivity during operations, which was addressed using string transformations. The project highlights the effective use of tools such as standard library utilities for sorting and mapping, as well as best practices for file handling, which are highly transferable skills for future projects.
Furthermore, the program's structure emphasizes readability through meaningful naming conventions and comments, while its modular design ensures adaptability for related applications.
These qualities make the program not only functional but also easy to maintain, expand, and adapt to similar data analysis tasks.
